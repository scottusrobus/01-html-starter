# Become a Web Developer: HTML Starter (#1)

## Project Resources
The following are assignment resources for the Skillshare course [Become a Web Developer: HTML Starter (#1)](https://www.skillshare.com/classes/Become-a-Web-Developer-HTML-Starter-1/828441821).

These are mock designs that I created for this course, but they are meant to look and feel like commerce sites that you could come across in the real world.

Choose and download the resources for a design by following the provided link. Each package will include a mockup for the site, a project cover image, and any image assets needed for the HTML document.

## Examples

Remember, there is not an exact way to markup a design with HTML. People will approach things a bit differently, and that's okay. If you are having trouble or would like to compare once done, you can check out my take on the HTML for each design:
