## Lesson 1 / Introduction  

[HTML Structure (#2)](https://), is the second course in a planned series of courses on Skillshare. I will teach you everything I know and have learned over my career in a series of mini-courses. The aim is to take you from complete beginner and bit by bit give you the knowledge, tools, and skills necessary to pursue a web development career.

### What you will learn
By the end of this mini-course, you will be able to look at a design for a website and code a complete and valid HTML document for it. You will learn the concepts and tools necessary to write HTML, to validate it, an be given resources that having at your disposal will help you along as you commit these tools and concepts to memory.

After completing this course you will be ready to begin taking things to the next level with either CSS or Javascript.

### Prerequisites
This mini-course builds off of my [HTML Starter (#1)](https://skl.sh/2OSUcHH) course. We take things one step further and learn how to tie down our HTML and establish a complete structure for our mock design. If you have a basic understanding of how HTML works, then the previous course is not required. However, if you are a complete beginner and are new to HTML, then I do recommended you check it out first.

In addition, to follow along using the same tools and setup that we are, you can checkout the [Tools & Setup](https://github.com/scottusrobus/become-a-web-developer/raw/master/01-html-starter/02-tools-and-setup) lesson from the HTML Starter course.
