## Project Demo
To give you an idea of how to do your own project, I demonstrated the required steps by finishing and publishing the HTML of our example site. For the completed HTML code.

**Class Example**  
A home decor and furniture online shop  
[Download Resources](example/package.zip)
[HTML Document]((example/index.html)

## Project Resources
Choose and download the resources for a design by following the provided link. Each package will include a mockup for the site, a project cover image, and any image assets needed for the HTML document. These are mock designs created specifically for this course, but they are meant to look and feel like commerce sites that you could come across in the real world.

**Design #1**  
A plant and flower online shop — [Download Resources](design-1/package.zip)

**Design #2**  
A coffee roaster online shop —
[Download Resources](design-2/package.zip)


### Examples

Remember, there is not an exact way to markup a design with HTML. People will approach things a bit differently, and that's okay. If you are having trouble or would like to compare once you've completed your own HTML, you can check out my take on the HTML for each design:

**Design #1**  
A plant and flower online shop — [HTML Document](design-1/index.html)

**Design #2**  
A coffee roaster online shop — [HTML Document]((design-2/index.html)
