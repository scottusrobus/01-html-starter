# HTML Starter (#1) — Class Project

## Project Steps

Your assignment will be to create and code an HTML document from one of the provided designs and then publish your work to GitHub Pages. You can break down the project into these steps:

1. Choose a homepage design and download the provided ZIP package with all the necessary resources. See the provided links in the Resources section below.
2. Use the Atom text editor to create an HTML document based on your chosen design.
3. Create a GitHub account and upload your finished work to Github Pages.
4. Use the provided image from the ZIP package for your Project Cover Image.
5. Post a link to your GitHub Pages HTML document source.
6. Post a link to your GitHub Pages live site.


## Project Demonstration
To give you an idea of how to do your own project, I demonstrate the required steps by finishing and publishing the HTML of our example site we began building in the class lessons. Here is the completed code from the lesson:

[HTML Document](example/index.html)

## Project Resources
Choose and download the resources for a design by following the provided link. Each package will include a mockup for the site, a project cover image, and any image assets needed for the HTML document. These are mock designs created specifically for this course, but they are meant to look and feel like commerce sites that you could come across in the real world.

### Examples

Remember, there is not an exact way to markup a design with HTML. People will approach things a bit differently, and that's okay. If you are having trouble or would like to compare once you've completed your own HTML, you can check out my take on the HTML for each design:
