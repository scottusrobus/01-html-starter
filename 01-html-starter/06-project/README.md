### HTML Starter (#1)
## Lesson 06 / Project

For your class project, you are going to practice your HTML skills by writing up the HTML for a site's primary header and promotional areas based on a mock design. We're starting out by honing in on just a particular part of the design, just like we did in the course lessons.

See the [Skillshare course](https://www.skillshare.com/classes/Become-a-Web-Developer-HTML-Starter-1/828441821) for a breakdown of the specific steps you will be taking.
