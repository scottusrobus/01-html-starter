## Lesson 6 / Project

For your class project, you are going to practice your HTML skills by writing up the HTML for the primary header area of a site based on a mock design. We're starting out by honing in on one particular part of the design, just like we did in the course lessons.

See the [Skillshare course](https://skl.sh/2OSUcHH) for a breakdown of the specific steps you will be taking.
