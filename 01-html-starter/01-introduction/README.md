### HTML Starter (#1)
## Lesson 01 / Introduction

[HTML Starter (#1)](https://www.skillshare.com/classes/Become-a-Web-Developer-HTML-Starter-1/828441821), is the first course in a planned series of courses on Skillshare. I will teach you everything I know and have learned over my career in a series of mini-courses. The aim is to take you from complete beginner and bit by bit give you the knowledge, tools, and skills necessary to pursue a web development career.

## What you will learn
By the end of this first mini-course, you will understand the basics of HTML. You will be able to look at something visual — a design for a website — and begin to code the basic HTML for it.

## Prerequisites
This course gives you your first step in web development. There are no prerequisites, and this course assumes you are a complete novice and that you have not done anything with web development before.
